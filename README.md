This project research aims to present the best awareness strategy for social engineering attacks, focusing on phishing. A focus group of about 19 of my co-workers was created to achieve this. The focus of this group was to bring awareness to the dangers of phishing while also gathering research on how effective social engineering awareness is. 
To start this research, a malicious link was sent to the group to see how many people would fall victim to the "phishing attack". After a while, the information was collected and a short training was conducted to sensitize the participants to malicious links and how they can be harmful. This training also consisted of ways to avoid phishing attacks, thereby making them more socially aware. 
After the training, another malicious link was sent to the group to see how effective the awareness training was. The results of this research showed that the training had worked, making people more socially aware of cyber-attacks via phishing. 
In conclusion, my findings show that regular training and testing of employees is the best awareness strategy to avoid social engineering attacks.
